# Risk-Game-Final-Project
This is my first attempt at a risk game in java. The game is not currently in a working state 
and crashes too often to allow the user to play a real game. 

if someone wants to use the code it can be edited and ran on any Java compiler. There is no code to run the program 
on its own. All files must be in the same folder for the code to work properly. 

This project is open to the public and not under any copyright laws.
